Origami is derived from two Japanese words: Ori (folded) and Kami (paper).   
</p>
<p>
The word "Origami" is used as an inclusive term for all folding practices, regardless of their culture of origin.
</p>
<p>
Origami was initially known as orikata (folded shapes).
</p>
<p>
The hardest Origami to make is the Ancient Dragon designed by Satoshi Kamiya, which took around 16 hours of work.
</p>
<p>
The absolute easiest and best origami animal to start with is the origami cat face.
</p>
<p>
Origami helped inspire the book Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes, which was later turned into a movie.
